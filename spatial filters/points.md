# Spatial Filtering technique is used directly on pixels of an image. 
+ Mask is usually considered to be added in size so that it has a specific center pixel. This mask is moved on the image such that the center of the mask traverses all image pixels.

# Average Filter
+ The filtered image is slightly blurred. If we increase the size of the averaging mask, more blurring can be obtained.

# Median Filter
+ median filtered image is considerably enhanced with hardly any salt and pepper noise in it.
