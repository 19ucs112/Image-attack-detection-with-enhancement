Steps to run the histogrameq.py file
first download the histogrameq.py file 
there are some minimal changes to do in the histogrameq.py file
as the input image on which histogram equalization is to be done is given by th user when the program prompts him
before running the program create a folder named output in your home diretory
all the processed images of fingerprints and histograms before and after histogram equalization are stored in this folder 
now open the code and you need to change all the plt.savefig() commands which are visible in code with the path of output directory created by you
if the path visible to you is like /home/shaik/output/img_before_eq then /home/{user}/output will be the path of your output folder and /img_before_eq will be your file name i.e to be saved
however you may change these names as per your convention
and if you're running this .py file in ubuntu make sure you have installed numpy,opencv,matplotlib in your ubuntu
you may refer to online sources for help installing these things
now once all the setup and changes are done 
you can run this .py file in ubuntu using python histogrameq.py command in terminal in the directory where file is present
as you run this the code will ask you whether the data of previously processed fingerprints is moved from the output directory or not
it is better to move the previously processed fingerprints data to another location before processng for new fingerprints as the code rewrites the same image files so we have a chance of losing previously saved data if not moved from that directory
if yes the code will ask you for the input you should provide the exact location path where your fingerprnt image is present including the type of the image like .jpg, .jpeg
or else your program execution exits with an error
if the previously processed data is not moved from the output folder you may enter no the program terminates itself and you may move the data to another location and you can run the file again
finally the programs shows the success message after processing fingerprints and terminates.
